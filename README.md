As hypertension is more and more common disease it is important (and pretty easy and inexpensive) to check own blood pressure.</br>
For adults the norm is 120 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and 80 mmHg for diastolic. Any reading above this values is a hypertension.</br>
For kids it is more complicated. You need to specify kid's: age, gender, and height to find if blood pressure is within norm.
